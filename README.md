CSS Reloader
=================

CSS Reloader is a browser extension which allows developers to reload CSS without reloading the page itself.

It's currently available for Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.

## Usage

You can reload all stylesheets via the keyboard shortcut F9, or via the context-menu's option "Reload CSS".

You are able to customize the keyboard shortcut under the extensions settings page.

## Limitations

CSS Reloader isn't reloading stylesheets references by @import (Been looking into this, and there's not easy solution.)
